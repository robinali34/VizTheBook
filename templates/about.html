<h3> About VizTheBook </h3>
<b>What are you trying to do with this project?</b><br>
<p>The main objective of undertaking this project is to build an automated software system with visualizations that can aid in finding, filtering and searching through books on a given topic without having to read them first.
</p>

<b>How is it done today; what are the limits of current practice?</b><br>
<p>Currently, readers try to manually find and compare books primarily by using online reviews provided by others. A major drawback in this approach is that it can neither give insights into what is contained in a book nor is it a robust approach to compare books of interest. There is also a possibility of reader reviews being biased.
Furthermore, for newly released and unreviewed books, there are no comparison reviews available at all.
</p>

<b>What's new in your approach; why it will be successful?</b><br>
<p>There are currently no services or tools to comprehensively search, analyze or compare books and to present the comparison results visually. The project can help to bridge this gap by helping to find and intuitively choose right books for readers. To accomplish this task, our analysis of Project Gutenberg books will output important topics, frequent keywords, and visualize them using a graph network where each book is linked by their most common shared topics as well as displaying images of the most important keywords. This allows the user to pictorially see what is contained in a book and how other books related to one another rapidly.
</p>

  <b>Who cares?</b><br>
<p>The proposed solution can help millions of readers across the world select and compare relevant books. The software could also be used by
teaching staff to quickly compare newly launched books for course recommendations to students.
The proposed system may also be of value to publishers to generate automatic reviews which readers can use while shortlisting books to read or buy.
</p>

  <b>If you're successful, what difference and impact will it make?</b><br>
<p>Everyday readers looking for their next good read can use our tool to see what type of book it is, what type of content is between the covers, and if it is interesting to them.
Techers/administrators need to find book/textbooks to accompany their lessons. Reading all potential books isn't feasible. The tool we will build will help them pick books that focus on the subjects that matter to these educators. Additionally our tools will give deeper insight to how books compare to others, so finding a related book becomes much easier.
Students can look at assigned textbooks for a course and put those books through our tool to see the type of material that will be covered in the course. This will help them make enrollment decisions.
</p>
  <p>
  We hope you enjoy this proof of concept!
